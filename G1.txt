Git and Github
---------------

1) Git is a free open-source Version Control System(VCS) that helps developers store code, track changes, and collaborate on projects.

-->What does Git do?

-Manage projects with Repositories
-Clone a project to work on a local copy
-Control and track changes with Staging and Committing
-Branch and Merge to allow for work on different parts and versions of a project
-Pull the latest version of the project to a local copy
-Push local updates to the main project

-->Working with Git
-Initialize Git on a folder, making it a Repository
-Git now creates a hidden folder to keep track of changes in that folder
-When a file is changed, added or deleted, it is considered modified
-You select the modified files you want to Stage
-The Staged files are Committed, which prompts Git to store a permanent snapshot of the files
-Git allows you to see the full history of every commit.
-You can revert back to any previous commit.
-Git does not store a separate copy of every file in every commit, but keeps track of changes made in each commit!

-->Why Git?
-Over 70% of developers use Git!
-Developers can work together from anywhere in the world.
-Developers can see the full history of the project.
-Developers can revert to earlier versions of a project.
-->What is GitHub?
-Git is not the same as GitHub.
-GitHub makes tools that use Git.
-GitHub is the largest host of source code in the world, and has been owned by Microsoft since 2018.

2) Local Repository (git commit -m "your message") [Here Commit is save changes.] 
1) Remote Repository (git push -u origin breanch)

Note:
